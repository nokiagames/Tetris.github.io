Created in 1984 by Russian programmer Alexei Pakitnov, Tetris was inspired by traditional Russian jigsaw puzzles, and its logical design reflects the perfect combination of mathematics and art. The player is immersed in a world of order and challenge, where each row of elimination is like a successful puzzle, and the moment a square hits the top of the stack is the moment of failure. These simple pixels and melodies are not only a game, but also a quiet time of childhood. Perhaps it's not just Tetris itself that we miss, but the pure time when we could devote ourselves to it. From this moment on, it will remain on the SOL chain forever！
