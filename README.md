Created in 1984 by Russian programmer Alexei Pakitnov, Tetris was inspired by traditional Russian jigsaw puzzles, and its logical design reflects the perfect combination of mathematics and art. The player is immersed in a world of order and challenge, where each row of elimination is like a successful puzzle, and the moment a square reaches the top of the stack is the moment of failure. These simple pixels and melodies are not only a game, but also a quiet time of childhood. Perhaps it's not just the game itself that we miss, but the pure time when we could devote ourselves to it. It's a moment he'll keep forever on SOL！

😊I hope you're happy！希望你开心！Надеюсь, вы счастливы！Espero que seas feliz！幸せになってほしい！행복하시길 바랍니다！

It's not the game itself that matters, it's the fond memories of childhood!
You don't have to look for who I am, you just need to remember Tetris and the programmer Alexei Pakitnov.
